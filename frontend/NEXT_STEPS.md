# Next Steps & Testing Guide: Design Gallery Expo Frontend

## 1. Prerequisites
- Ensure your backend API is running and accessible from your device.
- Update the API base URL in `src/services/api.ts` if needed.
- Install Expo Go on your phone (Android/iOS).

## 2. Start the Expo App
```bash
cd frontend
npx expo start --clear
```
- Scan the QR code with Expo Go on your phone.
- If you have network issues, try:
  - `npx expo start --tunnel`
  - Make sure phone and computer are on the same WiFi.

## 3. Test All User Flows

### Authentication
- Register a new user (should require admin approval if backend enforces it)
- Login with an approved user
- Logout and login again

### Design Gallery
- Browse the Home tab: should show a list of designs
- Tap a design: should open the Design Detail screen
- Design Detail: should show all images for the design (scrollable)

### Search
- Go to the Search tab
- Enter a query and search
- Tap a result to view its details

### Favorites
- Go to the Favorites tab
- Should show your favorite designs (if any)
- Tap a design to view details
- (Optional: toggle favorite in detail view if implemented)

### Cart
- Go to the Cart tab
- Should show your cart items (if any)
- Remove an item and verify it updates
- Check total items

### Profile
- Go to the Profile tab
- Should show your user info
- Tap Logout to log out

## 4. Error Handling
- Try logging in with wrong credentials (should show error)
- Try searching for a non-existent design (should show empty state)
- Disconnect backend and try to load data (should show error)

## 5. Troubleshooting
- If the app does not load, ensure Expo Go and your computer are on the same network
- If you see a spinner forever, check the Metro logs for errors
- If you get API errors, verify the backend URL and CORS settings
- For type errors, run:
  ```bash
  npx tsc --noEmit
  ```

## 6. Cleaning Up
- This file replaces the old README for testing and next steps.
- Unnecessary files have been removed from the project.
